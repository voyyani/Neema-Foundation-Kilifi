# Content Intake Guide for Neema Foundation Website

This guide explains how to provide the information and assets needed to build the NF website.

## Files to fill
- `docs/owner-questionnaire.md` — Write answers directly in the file.
- `docs/data-template.json` — Copy to a new file named `nf-content.json` and fill in all fields (keep IDs stable). Return the filled JSON.

## Media folder structure (Google Drive or Dropbox)
Create a shared folder with these subfolders and add links in the questionnaire/JSON:
- /Brand (logo, brand guidelines)
- /Hero (homepage photos/videos)
- /Programs/<Program Name> (photos, videos, PDFs)
- /Events/NF Cup 2025 (posters, schedule, photos)
- /Stories (case studies, quotes, photos)
- /Governance (board/staff photos, bios)

## Tips
- Prefer SVG for logos and high-resolution JPG/PNG for photos.
- Confirm consent for all identifiable photos.
- Use short, descriptive filenames.
- Dates should be ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD.
- Keep program/event IDs lowercase, hyphen-separated.

## Return
Email or share the completed `nf-content.json` and the questionnaire file, plus access to the media folders. We’ll import directly into the site components (Programs, Events, Donate, Volunteer, Bank Details, Stories).

If any section doesn’t apply, write “N/A.” We’ll adapt the site accordingly.
